5. Implement backup and disaster recovery

## Skills Demonstrated
- Infrastructure as Code (IaC) with Terraform
- Configuration Management with Ansible
- CI/CD Pipeline Development (GitLab CI & GitHub Actions)
- Container Orchestration with Docker
- Monitoring & Observability (Prometheus/Grafana)
- Git workflow and branch management
- Enterprise-grade project structure
- API integration and authentication
- Security scanning and best practices
- Documentation and process automation

## Architecture Components
- **Infrastructure Layer**: Terraform + Proxmox
- **Configuration Layer**: Ansible + Docker
- **Application Layer**: Nginx + Custom Web Apps
- **Monitoring Layer**: Prometheus + Grafana + Node Exporter
- **Automation Layer**: GitLab CI/CD + GitHub Actions
